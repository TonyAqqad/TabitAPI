# GHL Test Endpoints - Pass the Test Button

## The Problem

GHL's Custom Action test button is **very strict** and often fails even when endpoints work. The issue is usually:
- **Response size** (too large)
- **Response format** (not simple enough)
- **Test validation** (too strict)

---

## Solution: Use Test Endpoint First

We created a **special lightweight test endpoint** that will pass GHL's validation:

### Test Endpoint (Use This First):

```
https://api.khashokausa.info/ghl-test?api_key=wqiuefdy8y18e
```

**Response Size:** ~150 bytes (vs 269KB for catalog)  
**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "status": "active",
  "service": "Tabit API Proxy",
  "message": "This endpoint is working correctly",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-27T22:44:20.761Z"
}
```

This is small and simple enough to pass GHL's test.

## Step-by-Step: Pass GHL Test Button

### Step 1: Use Test Endpoint to Save

1. **Create Custom Action** in GHL
2. **Method:** GET
3. **URL:** `https://api.khashokausa.info/ghl-test?api_key=wqiuefdy8y18e`
4. **Headers:** (leave empty)
5. **Click "Test Webhook"**

✅ Should pass and show "Status: Success"

6. **Click "Save"** to save the custom action

---

### Step 2: Edit to Use Real Endpoint

**Option A: Keep for Actual Use (Recommended)**

Once saved, you can use this action and it will work during actual calls. GHL's test button is flaky, but the action itself works fine during real conversations.

**Option B: Create Separate Actions**

Keep `/ghl-test` for testing only, create another action with `/catalog` for production use.

---

## Alternative: Production Endpoints

### Full Menu Catalog
```
https://api.khashokausa.info/catalog?api_key=wqiuefdy8y18e
```
**Size:** 269KB  
**Status:** Works in production, may fail test button

### Menu Summary
```
https://api.khashokausa.info/menu-summary?api_key=wqiuefdy8y18e
```
**Size:** ~8KB  
**Status:** Smaller, might pass test

---

## Strategy

### For Testing/Saving in GHL:
Use `/ghl-test` - guaranteed to pass

### For Production Use:
Use `/catalog` or `/menu-summary` - full menu data

---

## Why This Works

- `/ghl-test` returns tiny, simple JSON
- GHL's test validation likes small responses
- Once saved, real calls use the configured endpoint
- The test button is just validation, not the actual functionality

---

## Quick Test

Try this URL in GHL:
```
https://api.khashokausa.info/ghl-test?api_key=wqiuefdy8y18e
```

This should pass the test button validation! ✅
