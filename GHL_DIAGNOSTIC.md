# GHL Diagnostic: Why Tabit Works But Worker Doesn't

## Investigation Results

### Both Endpoints Work Directly ✅
- Direct Tabit: 200 OK, 269 KB ✅
- Worker Proxy: 200 OK, 269 KB ✅

### Both Require Authentication ✅
- Tabit: integrator-token + organization-token headers
- Worker: X-API-Key header OR ?api_key= query parameter

### Secrets Configuration ✅
- PROXY_API_KEY: configured
- TABIT_INTEGRATOR_TOKEN: configured
- TABIT_ORG_TOKEN: configured

## The Key Difference

### Tabit Sandbox URL (Works in GHL)
```
https://us-demo-middleware.tabit-stage.com/menu
```

### Our Worker URL (Doesn't work in GHL test)
```
https://tabit-worker.tony-578.workers.dev/catalog
```

---

## Possible Causes

### 1. Domain Recognition
GHL may whitelist certain domains or have issues with `.workers.dev` domains in Custom Actions test mode. The `.tabit-stage.com` domain might be recognized differently.

### 2. Response Time
The Worker might be slightly slower (proxy + validation + Tabit), triggering GHL's timeout during test.

### 3. SSL/Certificate Chain
Cloudflare Workers use Cloudflare's SSL certificates, which might be validated differently by GHL's test infrastructure.

### 4. API Key Validation Layer
GHL test might have issues with the extra API key validation layer, even though it works direct.

---

## Test: Remove API Key Requirement

Let's try temporarily removing API key validation to see if that's the issue:

### Quick Test

Temporarily modify the worker to NOT require API key:

```javascript
function validateApiKey(request, env) {
  // Temporarily allow all requests
  return null;
  // Original code would check the key here
}
```

Then GHL would call:
```
https://tabit-worker.tony-578.workers.dev/catalog
```

No API key needed.

## Alternative: Use Tabit Direct (Bypass Worker)

If GHL's test button works with Tabit direct, use it in Custom Action:

### Direct Tabit Config
```
Method: GET
URL: https://us-demo-middleware.tabit-stage.com/menu

Headers:
  integrator-token: bcd1af29b23b40f4b642bb9c554b9b1f
  organization-token: 217f096507444e7cbbbf9a40ed61e5f6
```

This would work in GHL but:
- ❌ Exposes your Tabit credentials in GHL
- ❌ No caching
- ❌ No webhook handling

---

## Recommended: Keep Using Workflows

Since Custom Actions test button is unreliable:
- ✅ Use **GHL Workflows** for menu fetching (stored in custom field)
- ✅ Use **Custom Actions** only for order submission (when workflow triggers)
- ✅ This is the production-recommended approach

---

## Next Diagnostic Step

Run this test to see if it's the API key layer causing issues:

1. Temporarily make the Worker public (no API key required)
2. Try Custom Action with: `https://tabit-worker.tony-578.workers.dev/catalog`
3. If it works → API key validation was the issue
4. If it fails → Domain or infrastructure issue

Want me to create a test version without API key validation?
