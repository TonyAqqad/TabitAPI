# GHL Test Button Fix

## The Issue

Even though your endpoint works (returns 200 OK in Cloudflare logs), GHL's test button won't pass because the response is too large (269KB).

## The Solution: Use Menu Summary for Testing

### For GHL Test Button:

**Use this URL instead:**
```
https://api.khashokausa.info/menu-summary?api_key=wqiuefdy8y18e
```

**Size:** ~8KB (vs 269KB for catalog)  
**Format:** Same JSON, just condensed  

### Configuration:

```
Method: GET

URL: 
https://api.khashokausa.info/menu-summary?api_key=wqiuefdy8y18e

Headers: (Leave empty)

Body: (Leave empty)

Authentication: OFF
```

## Two Options for Production

### Option 1: Use menu-summary (RECOMMENDED for GHL)
- Smaller response (~8KB)
- Test button should pass
- Still has menu items
- Good for Voice AI

**URL:**
```
https://api.khashokausa.info/menu-summary?api_key=wqiuefdy8y18e
```

### Option 2: Use catalog (Full Menu)
- Complete menu with all details
- Large response (~269KB)
- Test button may fail
- Use for workflows instead

**URL:**
```
https://api.khashokausa.info/catalog?api_key=wqiuefdy8y18e
```

## Try This in GHL:

1. Edit your Custom Action
2. Change URL to:
   ```
   https://api.khashokausa.info/menu-summary?api_key=wqiuefdy8y18e
   ```
3. Click "Test Webhook"
4. Should now pass! âœ…

## Why This Works

- `/menu-summary` returns condensed menu (47 items)
- Response is ~8KB instead of 269KB
- GHL's test button handles smaller responses
- Still has all the menu data Voice AI needs

## After Test Passes

1. Save the Custom Action
2. Enable it in your Voice AI
3. Make a test call
4. Ask: "What appetizers do you have?"
5. AI should fetch and list items

## For Production: Switch to catalog if needed

Once you're in production and the test button doesn't matter:
- You can switch back to `/catalog` for full menu
- Or keep using `/menu-summary` - it's perfectly adequate for Voice AI

**The menu-summary endpoint has all the essential information.**
